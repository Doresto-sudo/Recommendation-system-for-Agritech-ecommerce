**User Behavior Modeling for Agritech E-Commerce**

**Project Overview**:  This project focuses on identifying distinct behavioral archetypes within an agritech e-commerce platform. By analyzing over 10,000 transactions, my team and I were to develop a customer recommendations system to improve customer retention and increase customer base.

**My Task**: I developed an unsupervised learning model using K-Means clustering to segment customers into 4 groups. This segmentation enabled personalized recommendations that matched the right intervention to a user’s specific profile.

**Technical Stack**
- Language: Python (Google Colab Notebook)
- Libraries: Scikit-learn (K-Means), Pandas (ETL & Data Cleaning), Matplotlib/Seaborn (Visualization), Streamlit
- Concepts: Unsupervised Learning, Feature Scaling, Elbow Method for Optimal K.

**Key Features**
* End-to-End ETL Pipeline: Processed and cleaned raw transactional data, handling missing values and normalizing features for clustering.
* Behavioral Segmentation: Applied K-Means Clustering to identify 4 distinct customer segments based on purchase frequency, average spend, and product category interest.
* Actionable Insights: Translated mathematical clusters into business personas, including dormant customers, new customers, loyal customers, and mixed profiles.

**Results**  
- Identified 4 clear behavioral segments.
- Provided the data foundation for a recommendation engine intended to improve customer retention by 85%.
